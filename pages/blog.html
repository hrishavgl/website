		<h2>On the Inevitability of Technology</h2>

		<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap;">
			<p style="flex: 60%;">Technology in our current day and age is something we have begun to take for granted. The advent of technology is no longer a wonder but a massive part of the fabric of our societies. People now feel crippled without technology as everything we do is becoming more and more interconnected with technology. For example, a year or so ago, Google services experienced a worldwide outage for hours. Because of this, many people couldn't access their emials, access online classes, or run integral parts of their business. Some people even became locked out of their integrated smart home systems making them unable to turn on lights, access temperature controls, or even open doors. Such habits of trading stability for convenience will become our own detriment.</p>

			<p style="flex: 60%">The invention of various cutting end technologies has revolutionized the modern world. Currently, we are seeing technologies such as cryptocurrencies evolve very rapidly. Bitcoin has become more and more a serious form of investment in the public eye. Very recently even online commodities such are being sold though cryptocurrencies. For example, Twitter's CEO Jack Dorsey sold his first ever tweet for approximately 3 million dollars. And during a pandemic where a lot of sectors in every economy worldwide was severely impacted, the technological companies and businesses thrived. This is a perfect representation of the disruptive nature of technology which has both, positive as well as negative implications.</p>

		<h2>Positive and Negative Implications</h2>
		
		<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap;">
			<p style="flex: 60%;">The positive aspects of technology cannot simply be downplayed. Technological advancements in medicine have heavily increased the general lifespan compared to just a century ago. We are also much more educated and well informed. People have gained access to many specialized occupations like web designing which were unheard of a few generations earlier. This has lead to vastly more opportunities and has created an overall wealthier society. Technologies like the internet have made us all connect and better understand each other. People from all around the world get to meet up and collaborate. We get to experience aspects of cultures far removed from our own.</p>

		<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap;">
			<img src="../images/broken.jpg" alt="a broken television screen" style="flex: 30%; width: 200px; padding: 30px;">
			<p style="flex: 60%">The negative impacts of technology are in a sort of equilibrium with the positive ones. That is to say that there are just as many negative uses of technology. Highly powerful military weapons, aircraft, submarines, etc are some things that come to mind. But what is perhaps even scarier is the impact that Artificial Intelligence technology will have in the future. After all, the fear of the unknown is one of mankind's greatest tribulations. Companies and governments alike have access to vast hordes of data of people from all walks of life and from all parts of the world. Throughout history, there have often been thefts of physical property. But the large scale thefts of intellectual property we are seeing right now is truly novel.</p>

		<h2>What this means for the future</h2>
		<p>In conclusion, all of this is to say that the rapid advent of technology cannot be classified as either entirely good or entirely bad. Moving into the future, we will have to deal with this moral ambiguity that is associated with virtually every new technological leap. We mustn't blindly jump on every new technological bandwagon but rather we must be optimistic and try to influence the rise of technologies that are genuinely beneficial for humanity in the long term. </p>
