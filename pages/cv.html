				<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<p>I am Hrishav Gajurel, my age is 19 years and my height is 6ft 2in. I was born and am currently living in Kathmandu, the capital of Nepal. I generally maintain a pretty cheerful attitute. I don't watch or play much sports but I do like to go on morning/evening walks for exercise. I really enjoy listening to music and audiobooks, preferably in the peace and quiet of late night or very early morning. I am fluent in English and Nepali, have a pretty firm grasp of Hindi, and can understand the Russian alphabet, although I don't understand the language.</p>
				<p>My hobbies currently include learning to draw sketches and learning to play the ukulele. I am also starting to invest in the stock market as my first steps towards financial intelligence and independence. I am also in the process of learning to drive a car. On a more technological side, building this website has gotten me really invested into web design and I would like to improve this website in the future for professional use.</p>
